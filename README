## This is the [DICE](https://bitbucket.org/vperret/dice) bitbucket repository.

DICE is an open source code to model initial conditions of idealised galaxies to study their secular evolution, or to study more complex interactions such as mergers or compact groups using N-Body/hydro codes.
DICE writes the initial conditions in the **Gadget1** or **Gadget2** format and is fully compatible with [Ramses][2] thanks to the **[dice-ramses][3]** patch.

You can go to the user's guide [here][1].

Download the code by cloning the git repository using 
```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/vperret/dice
```
